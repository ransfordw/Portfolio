          <h2 class="section-heading text-white">A little about me</h2>
          <br>
          <p class="text-faded mb-4">Hello World! I am relatively new to the world of web development and coding. I
            grew
            up on the southside of Indianapolis raising chickens and sheep for 4-H and exploring the wilds that were my
            back
            yard. I was incredibly fascinated with nature and how things grew; I was always walking around with my head
            down
            looking at whatever I could find. We had an aquarium that we kept crawdads in from te creek that we would
            watch
            and learn how they hunted, ate, and lived. This close proximity to livestock and our woods helped foster my
            curiosity
            for biology. In high school, I found myself taking elective sciences whenever I could. It seemed I couldn't
            gain
            enough knowledge on the subject to satisfy my curiosity. Dissections, designing my own experiments, and
            field
            trips surveying local streams all gave my hands on experiences that spurred on my curiosity for biology.</p>
          <p class="text-faded mb-4">I also found my first job in high school. I had done several odd jobs but
            eventually
            got hired at a local Chick-fil-A. There I learned the value of team work, learning how to function with
            people
            that never did their work, drove you crazy, or that you enjoyed working with so much that you had to work
            hard
            to stay focused. It was a great place to fail and learn. Our owner set a number of us down shortly after
            the
            2008 recession and spoke with us about his goals to not let anyone go because of the financial state of the
            economy.
            He then pointed out areas he had seen in us that warrented improvements, hinting that if he had to let
            people
            go that those things would be considered. We all shaped up our acts after that but I learned how important
            it
            is to care for your team and share you goals with them. A skill that helped me excel as a manager at that
            same
            Chick-fil-A a few years later.</p>
          <p class="text-faded mb-4">In college my interest in biology and sciences continued to grow. After a year of
            being
            an indescisive freshman I declared a major in biology and started trying to catch up to my class. I bit off
            more
            than I could chew and my grades reflected that. Moving forward I took more care to grab a manageable
            workload
            and started learning better boundaries between studying and resting. I ended up being one of the few
            students
            I knew who enjoyed organic chemistry and loved taking advanced biology courses. I loved learning the
            details
            of how life worked, what chemicals made us up, how our DNA codes our proteins to carry out tasks both
            simple
            and complex, and how the slightest deviation could throw everything off. By the time I was a senior I had
            developed
            a deep love for learning new things.</p>
          <p class="text-faded mb-4">Shortly after college I was married and back at Chick-fil-A. Much to my dismay, my
            biology
            degree could not guarantee the income level I had been promised going into college without further
            schooling
            and engagement rings and loans are costly. Chick-fil-A could at least give me steady income, but also so
            much
            more. In my three years I spent there after college that same owner continued to give me opportunities to
            grow
            and learn. I moved up through the ranks until I was responsibile for managing the daytime operations and
            overseeing
            food safety procedures for two locations. In managing people, I learned to invest time in people as
            individuals
            and that in turn makes a more cohesive and productive team, that unresolved conflict can undoe great
            amounts
            of work, and that setting measurable goals are more effective that broad visions.</p>
          <p class="text-faded mb-4">Eventually I knew my time with Chick-fil-A would come to a close. Ten hour days,
            4:00am
            alarms, and working nearly every saturday took a toll on me and my time with my family. I searched for six
            months
            for jobs that my degree would qualify me for but had no luck. After several conversations, a good friend of
            mine
            convinced me to try my hand at coding, and look at this! I've made a website! I had no idea how much I
            would
            enjoy the challenge and problemsolving that comes with this field and I am eager to find a job where I can
            keep
            learning and developing myself.</p>
